      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on the
        internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I
        decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together
        a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS! Fast-forward to
        today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a
        start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main
        focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital
        experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients. I also recently
        launched a course that covers everything you need to build a web app
        with the Spotify API using Node & React.

      <h2>Build a Spotify Connected App</h2>
      <p>
        Having struggled with understanding how the Spotify OAuth flow works, I
        made the course I wish I could have had. Unlike tutorials that only
        cover a few concepts and leave you with half-baked GitHub repositories,
        this course covers everything from explaining the principles of REST
        APIs to implementing Spotify's OAuth flow and fetching API data in a
        React app. By the end of the course, you’ll have an app deployed to the
        internet you can add to your portfolio.
