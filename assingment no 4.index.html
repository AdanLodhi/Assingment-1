      >The Wazir Khan Mosque (Punjabi and Urdu: مسجد وزیر خان ; Persian: مسجد
      وزیر خان; Masjid Wazīr Khān) is a 17th-century mosque located in the city
      of Lahore, capital of the Pakistani province of Punjab. The mosque was
      commissioned during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a part
      of an ensemble of buildings that also included the nearby Shahi Hammam
      baths. Construction of Wazir Khan Mosque began in 1634 C.E., and was
      completed in 1641.[1] It is on the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative
      List.[2] Considered to be the most ornately decorated Mughal-era
      mosque,[3] Wazir Khan Mosque is renowned for its intricate faience tile
      work known as kashi-kari, as well as its interior surfaces that are almost
      entirely embellished with elaborate Mughal-era frescoes. The mosque has
      been under extensive restoration since 2009 under the direction of the Aga
      Khan Trust for Culture and the Government of Punjab,[4] with contributions
      from the governments of Germany, Norway, and the United States.[5]</span

      >Minar E Pakistan (Urdu: مینارِ پاکستان, literally "Tower of Pakistan") is
      a tower located in Lahore, Pakistan.[2] The tower was built between 1960
      and 1968 on the site where the All-India Muslim League passed the Lahore
      Resolution (which was later called the Pakistan Resolution) on 23 March
      1940 - the first official call for a separate and independent homeland for
      the Muslims of British India, as espoused by the two-nation theory. The
      resolution eventually helped lead to the creation of Pakistan in
      1947.[3][4] The tower is located in the middle of an urban park, called
      the Greater Iqbal Park.[5</span

      >The Badshahi Mosque (Urdu, Punjabi: بادشاہی مسجد; literally The Royal
      Mosque) is a Mughal-era congregational mosque in Lahore, capital of the
      Pakistani province of Punjab.[1][2] The mosque is located west of Lahore
      Fort along the outskirts of the Walled City of Lahore, and is widely
      considered to be one of Lahore's most iconic landmarks.[3] The Badshahi
      Mosque was constructed by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb between 1671 and
      1673 and was the largest mosque in the world from 1673 to 1986. The mosque
      is an important example of Mughal architecture, with an exterior that is
      decorated with carved red sandstone with marble inlay. It remains the
      largest mosque of the Mughal-era, and is the third-largest mosque in
      Pakistan.[4] After the fall of the Mughal Empire, the mosque was used as a
      garrison by the British Empire, and is now one of Pakistan's most iconic
      sights.[1]</span

      >The Shalamar Gardens (Urdu: شالامار باغ, romanized: Shālāmār Bāgh) are a
      Mughal garden complex located in Lahore, Pakistan. The gardens date from
      the period when the Mughal Empire was at its artistic and aesthetic
      zenith,[1] and are now one of Pakistan's most popular tourist
      destinations. The Shalimar Gardens were laid out as a Persian paradise
      garden intended to create a representation of an earthly utopia in which
      humans co-exist in perfect harmony with all elements of nature.[2]
      Construction of the gardens began in 1641 during the reign of Emperor Shah
      Jahan,[2] and was completed in 1642.[3] In 1981 the Shalimar Gardens were
      inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as they embody Mughal garden
      design at the apogee of its development.[1]</span
