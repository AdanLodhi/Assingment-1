        ‘Gadget’ as a term to describe our tech equipment doesn’t really hit the
        mark these days. ‘Accessories vital for life’ is probably more accurate,
        because let’s face it, we can’t do without them, especially given that
        so many of us are working more flexibly now. Our phones, laptops and
        workspaces have become a core part of who we are on a day-to-day basis
        so it only makes sense to take pride in them. Hence why a massive
        complementary industry in tech and desk accessories has emerged, imbuing
        our quotidian processes with sophistication and style, while protecting
        our kit at the same time.Here’s our pick of the best brands in the space
        making our working lives that much more interesting.

        While the days of huge leather-topped mahogany desks have gone the way
        of the dinosaurs, the designers at Carl Friedrik have referenced that
        nostalgia and distilled it into thoroughly contemporary leather desk
        mats and mouse mats. Made from beautifully soft vegetable-tanned
        Vachetta leather – burnished and brushed for durability – the mats of
        various sizes come in black, cognac and chocolate tones, providing a
        strong contrast of rich colour against a modern white workspace. Looks
        aside, they make sitting at your desk that much more inviting, which
        can’t be a bad thing for your deadlines.

        Here at Ape, we’ve always been staunch advocates of classic style,
        clothing that’s built to last and getting the most out of every garment.
        These core values put us fundamentally at odds with the rising trend for
        pre-battered, artificially grubby footwear, but we’d be lying if we said
        there weren’t a couple of distressed sneaker models that have caught our
        eye in recent years. Distressed sneakers are sneakers that have been
        deliberately made to look worn in, and in some cases, completely
        destroyed right out of the box (we’re looking at you Balenciaga).
        Champions of the look claim it means they can have a shoe that feels
        well loved and has character without the wait, while naysayers call it
        nonsensical at best and classist at worst. Whichever side of the
        argument you’re on, there’s no denying that distressed sneakers are fast
        becoming a genre of footwear in their own right. Now with many brands
        creating their own versions, we thought it would be a good time to take
        a detailed look at some of the trend’s most notable models.
